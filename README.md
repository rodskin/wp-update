# wp-update

Add your databases changes in the data folder. 

Samples can be found in the samples folder

ACFs json fields will be uploaded in the "acf-json" folder automatically

Multisite is taken care of, in the multisite admin, you will find WP-update and a settings page where you will be able to select or not a master site for ACFs.
